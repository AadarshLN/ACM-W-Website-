Google provides this scholarship every year in honor of Dr. Anita Borg’s vision of creating gender equality in the field of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is highly competitive with Google receiving about 25,000 applications from the APAC region this year. Around 1250 candidates were shortlisted for phone interviews and finally, 73 scholars were awarded the scholarship. When I came across this scholarship, I decided to apply as I had pretty much nothing else to do at that time :P. The application consisted of three essay questions, which were mainly aimed at the applicant’s understanding of issues that affect diversity in tech and technical or social contributions to improve diversity. Along with the essays, we were required to submit our resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/wtm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Demo Image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call for the next round of interviews depends on the strength of your application. The essay answers should reflect who you are and the work that you do for the community. Academic excellence and leadership skills are also considered but if you don’t have a 9+ GPA, fret not. GPA is just one of the factors and if you have achieved something or worked on a project which speaks louder than the GPA, then you are good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a mail about a month later asking me for a preferred interview date and time. I was quite excited as it was a phone interview with a Google Engineer. One of the things I did before the interview was to go through all my essays and I kept a copy with me for the interview. The interviewer was from the Bangalore office and we had a very engaging discussion on a lot of things from my essays to how tech has changed the world and the downsides of it. It went on for about 45 minutes. I also got to know more about WTM and how Google would help me reach out to the community if I got the scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks passed after the interview and I hadn’t heard back from them so assuming the worst, I forgot about it. One fine evening, I received a phone call in the evening from Anjali Thakur, who manages WTM activities in India. She told me that I had got the scholarship and I would be flying to Singapore for the retreat. After all the hustle and bustle of filling forms to get the visa, I finally left for Singapore on October 9th. We had a welcome dinner at the hotel that night where we met the other scholars and some Googlers. What started off as an evening with strangers turned into a fun-filled karaoke night with everyone talking and laughing with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, we reached the Google office in the morning and started off with breakfast in their cafeteria which has an extensive variety of food and beverages. After breakfast, we headed to a room where we were heard from different speakers about their experiences. There were events, talks, and workshops planned out for three days. Most of them revolved around finding solutions to problems women in STEM faced. I heard some amazing stories about how some of the scholars fought against unequal pay and discrimination in workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt; --&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/wtm-img3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Demo Image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the retreat, we had bonded with complete strangers and we shared stories, experiences and laughed our hearts out. That was the most beautiful part of my trip - the other amazing, talented women I got to meet. We still remain in touch through social media and continue to support each other. The retreat was just the start of the amazing journey ahead. With the resources and support from Google, each of the scholars continue to make a greater impact on the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my fourth semester, I decided to make the most of my summer after my second year, after finally getting into my branch.
    But If you're a second year, you don't have the opportunity to sit through the placement tests and interviews to land an internship as the third years do. This was when I found out about Codess through my senior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;What is codess?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codess is a program for female Coders initiated by Microsoft, established in an effort to promote gender diversity and to be inclusive in the engineering field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eligibility: Undergraduate 2nd year female students from any branch are eligible for Codess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;What is the selection process?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registration links rolled out by the end of February, and everyone who registered had to go through an online assessment test to assess our potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the students were selected for a Summer mentorship program which would give you a headstart in your internship process. Another select few would get to visit the MS campus, participate in a hackathon and have a chance to bag a summer internship at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 students from NITK were selected to travel to the Microsoft campus in Bangalore for a 2-day event in the beginning of March. On the first day, we networked with Microsoft employees as well as students from other campuses. We had a hands-on technology workshop and on the next day, we were divided into teams for a mentored conceptual hackathon. Each team then pitched their ideas to judges, who chose the top four teams to present their ideas to the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our performance for the ideathon, we were offered internships for 8 weeks during the summer after our second year.  Even if your team wasn’t in the top four, your individual performance is what will be evaluated, so be sure to do your best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;How do I prepare for Codess?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the online assessment tests, good logic, basic DSA knowledge and being comfortable with one programming language is sufficient. However, at the MS campus you are judged for your team working ability, creativity, communication and presentation skills. Focus on presenting your genuine, enthusiastic self and it will certainly give you an edge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;What was your Internship Experience at Microsoft IDC?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working in Foundry as a software developer in the Microsoft ISC at Hyderabad. In Foundry, each project is assigned 4 software devs, consisting of two second years and two third years (possibly even a fifth design intern), and this team will be responsible for the development of their project. Each team will have a couple of mentors to guide them in the right direction, and provide them with the necessary resources. The mentors were all extremely helpful and assisted us throughout our internship experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Foundry had a common working space, all the interns were soon interacting and bonding while simultaneously learning and applying their knowledge in their respective projects. There were ‘break areas’, with table tennis and pool tables, a small library and even a karaoke machine!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt; --&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Expectations vs Reality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interns that were part of Foundry were lucky enough to have a choice in which project they would work on, which I was not expecting. Microsoft’s flexible yet efficient work schedule and attitude to project development allowed us to work without feeling overworked while at the same time ensuring that we don’t underdeliver. The fact that the company took a keen interest in making sure that we had an enriching internship time, even outside the company, was very refreshing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the wonderful work culture, talented professionals, and enthusiastic peers all added up to an enriching memorable internship experience!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Linu George</name></author><summary type="html">This article is to give you some insight about how I got the Codess internship, what being thrown into the corporate world felt like, and a little about my work life in Hyderabad.</summary></entry></feed>
