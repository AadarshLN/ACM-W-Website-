        <p>The Google Women Techmakers Scholarship, previously known as Anita Borg Scholarship is aimed at providing visibility, community, and resources for women in technology. Google provides this scholarship every year in honor of Dr. Anita Borg’s vision of creating gender equality in the field of computer science.</p>

<p>It is highly competitive with Google receiving about 25,000 applications from the APAC region this year. Around 1250 candidates were shortlisted for phone interviews and finally, 73 scholars were awarded the scholarship. When I came across this scholarship, I decided to apply as I had pretty much nothing else to do at that time :P. The application consisted of three essay questions, which were mainly aimed at the applicant’s understanding of issues that affect diversity in tech and technical or social contributions to improve diversity. Along with the essays, we were required to submit our resume.</p>

<p>The call for the next round of interviews depends on the strength of your application. The essay answers should reflect who you are and the work that you do for the community. Academic excellence and leadership skills are also considered but if you don’t have a 9+ GPA, fret not. GPA is just one of the factors and if you have achieved something or worked on a project which speaks louder than the GPA, then you are good to go.</p>

<p>I received a mail about a month later asking me for a preferred interview date and time. I was quite excited as it was a phone interview with a Google Engineer. One of the things I did before the interview was to go through all my essays and I kept a copy with me for the interview. The interviewer was from the Bangalore office and we had a very engaging discussion on a lot of things from my essays to how tech has changed the world and the downsides of it. It went on for about 45 minutes. I also got to know more about WTM and how Google would help me reach out to the community if I got the scholarship.</p>

<p>A few weeks passed after the interview and I hadn’t heard back from them so assuming the worst, I forgot about it. One fine evening, I received a phone call in the evening from Anjali Thakur, who manages WTM activities in India. She told me that I had got the scholarship and I would be flying to Singapore for the retreat. After all the hustle and bustle of filling forms to get the visa, I finally left for Singapore on October 9th. We had a welcome dinner at the hotel that night where we met the other scholars and some Googlers. What started off as an evening with strangers turned into a fun-filled karaoke night with everyone talking and laughing with each other.</p>

<p>The next day, we reached the Google office in the morning and started off with breakfast in their cafeteria which has an extensive variety of food and beverages. After breakfast, we headed to a room where we were heard from different speakers about their experiences. There were events, talks, and workshops planned out for three days. Most of them revolved around finding solutions to problems women in STEM faced. I heard some amazing stories about how some of the scholars fought against unequal pay and discrimination in workplaces.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>At the end of the retreat, we had bonded with complete strangers and we shared stories, experiences and laughed our hearts out. That was the most beautiful part of my trip - the other amazing, talented women I got to meet. We still remain in touch through social media and continue to support each other. The retreat was just the start of the amazing journey ahead. With the resources and support from Google, each of the scholars continue to make a greater impact on the community.</p>
